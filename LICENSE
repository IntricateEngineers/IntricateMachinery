INTRICATE ENGINEERS PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING,
DISTRIBUTION, AND MODIFICATION.

 1. Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a dick. Being a
    dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

    a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the
    name.

    b. Not disclosing the source of a derived work. Open source software is not
       only a great thing for the community, but also a great way to work as a
       developer that we highly recommend for all your other projects as well.

    c. Selling the original or a derived work. Methods of monetization that are
       either optional for the end user (e.g. accepting donations etc.), or not
       directly paid by the end user (e.g. Ads on download links etc.) is
       permitted.

    d. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would
       make you a PROPER dick.

 2. Code is provided with no warranty. If you encounter problems and fix them
    yourself, we would appreciate if you shared your fix.

 3. We reserve the right to change this license at any time. However, like you,
    we will try to not be dicks.

 4. If you are ever in doubt about this license, contact the current maintainers
    and we will answer any questions.
